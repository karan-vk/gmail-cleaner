## Feature Requests

Lets make this tool a better one by improving as much as possible, All features are welcome, To request a feature, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Gururagavendra/gmail-cleaner/issues/new).

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Local (Python)**: [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## Setup

**Important**: You must create your **OWN** Google Cloud credentials. This app doesn't include pre-configured OAuth - that's what makes it privacy-focused! Each user runs their own instance with their own credentials.

### 1. Get Google OAuth Credentials

**Video Tutorial**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/CmOWn8Tm5ZE) for a visual walkthrough

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Search for **"Gmail API"** and **Enable** it
4. Go to **Google Auth Platform**  → Click **"Get started"**
5. Fill in the wizard:
   - **App Information**: Enter app name (e.g., "Gmail Cleanup"), select your email
   - **Audience**: Select **External**
   - **Contact Information**: Add your email address
   - Click **Create**
6. Go to **Audience** (left sidebar) → Scroll to **Test users**
   - Click **Add Users** → Add your Gmail address → **Save**
7. Go to **Clients** (left sidebar) → **Create Client**
   - Choose the application type based on your setup:

   | Setup | Application Type | Redirect URI |
   |-------|------------------|--------------|
   | **Local/Desktop** (Python with browser) | Desktop app | Not needed |
   | **Docker (localhost)** | Web application | `http://localhost:8767/` |
   | **Docker/Remote Server (public domain)** | Web application | `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_DOMAIN:8767/` |

   > **⚠️ Important**: Redirect URIs must use a **domain name** (e.g., `gmail.example.com`), **NOT an IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`). Google OAuth does not allow IP addresses. If you need to use a server IP, use a [Dynamic DNS service](#custom-domain--reverse-proxy--remote-server) to get a domain name.

   - Name: "Gmail Cleanup" (or anything)
   - Click **Create**
   - Click **Download** (downloads JSON file)
   - Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json`

> **💡 Which should I choose?**
> - Running locally with Python (`uv run python main.py`)? → **Desktop app**
> - Running with Docker or on a remote server? → **Web application**
>
> **Note**: If using custom port mapping or a custom domain, see [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) for redirect URI details.

### 2. Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gururagavendra/gmail-cleaner.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd gmail-cleaner
```

3. Put your `credentials.json` file in the project folder.

## Usage

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

1. Pull the latest image and start the container:
```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

2. Open the app in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8766
```

3. Click **"Sign In"** button in the web UI

4. Check logs for the OAuth URL (only after clicking Sign In!):
```bash
docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/gururagavendra/gmail-cleaner)
```
Or if you built locally:
```bash
docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter name=gmail-cleaner)
```

5. Copy the Google OAuth URL from logs, open in browser, and authorize:
   - Choose your Google account
   - "Google hasn't verified this app" → Click **Continue**
     > This warning appears because you created your own OAuth app (not published to Google). This is expected and safe - you control the app!
   - Grant permissions → Click **Continue**
   - Done! You'll see "Authentication flow has completed"

> **🌐 Using a custom domain, remote server, or custom port mapping?** See [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) for setup instructions.

#### Persisting Authentication (Data Directory)

The `docker-compose.yml` includes a `data` directory volume mount that automatically persists your authentication token.

**How it works:**

- The `./data` directory on your host is mounted to `/app/data` in the container
- When you authenticate, `token.json` is automatically saved to `/app/data/token.json` inside the container
- This file is persisted to `./data/token.json` on your host filesystem
- On subsequent container restarts, your authentication persists automatically

**No manual steps required!**

- ✅ First-time setup: Just run `docker compose up` - the `data` directory is created automatically
- ✅ Authentication persists: Your token is saved to `./data/token.json` on the host
- ✅ Container restarts: Your authentication is automatically loaded from the persisted file

**To reset authentication:**

If you need to sign in with a different account or reset authentication:

```bash
# Stop the container
docker compose down

# Remove the token file
rm -f ./data/token.json

# Start again (will prompt for new authentication)
docker compose up
```

### Option B: Python (with uv)

```bash
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

The app opens at http://localhost:8766


## FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to create my own Google Cloud project?**  
> Because this app accesses your Gmail. By using your own OAuth credentials, you have full control and don't need to trust a third party.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
> Yes! The code is open source - you can inspect it. Your emails are processed locally on your machine.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple Gmail accounts?**  
> Yes! Click "Sign Out" and sign in with a different account. Each account needs to be added as a test user in your Google Cloud project.

**Q: Emails went to Trash, can I recover them?**  
> Yes! The delete feature moves emails to Trash. Go to Gmail → Trash to recover within 30 days.

**Q: Having OAuth authentication issues?**  
> Check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for common solutions.

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Port Mapping / Docker Port Override

If you're using **custom port mappings** in Docker (e.g., mapping `18766:8766` and `18767:8767`):

1. **Update docker-compose.yml**:

   ```yaml
   services:
     gmail-cleaner:
       ports:
         - "18766:8766"  # Web UI (external:internal)
         - "18767:8767"  # OAuth callback (external:internal)
       environment:
         - WEB_AUTH=true
         - OAUTH_EXTERNAL_PORT=18767  # External port that browser will use
   ```

2. **Update Google Cloud Console** redirect URI:
   - Go to **Clients** → Your OAuth client → **Authorized redirect URIs**
   - Update to: `http://localhost:18767/` (or `http://YOUR_DOMAIN:18767/` if using custom domain)
   - **Note**: Must be a domain name, not an IP address

3. **Restart the container**:

   ```bash
   docker compose down && docker compose up
   ```

> **💡 How it works**: The app listens on port 8767 inside the container, but sets the OAuth redirect URI to use port 18767 (the external port). Docker forwards the external port to the internal port.

### Custom Domain / Reverse Proxy / Remote Server

If you're accessing via a **custom domain** (e.g., `gmail.example.com`) instead of `localhost`:

> **⚠️ Important**:
> - Use **Web application** credentials (not Desktop app) for remote server setups. See [Step 7 in Get Google OAuth Credentials](#1-get-google-oauth-credentials).
> - **IP addresses are NOT allowed** in Google OAuth redirect URIs. You must use a domain name (e.g., `gmail.example.com`), not an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
> - Google requires redirect URIs to use a public top-level domain (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.)

**Allowed redirect URIs:**
- ✅ `http://localhost:8767/` (for local access)
- ✅ `http://gmail.example.com:8767/` (custom domain)
- ✅ `http://mygmail.duckdns.org:8767/` (dynamic DNS)
- ❌ `http://192.168.1.100:8767/` (IP addresses not allowed)
- ❌ `http://10.0.0.5:8767/` (private IPs not allowed)

**If you need to use a server IP:**
- Use a **dynamic DNS service** (free options: [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/), [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/), [Dynu](https://www.dynu.com/))
- Point the domain to your server's IP address
- Use the domain name in OAuth (e.g., `http://mygmail.duckdns.org:8767/`)

1. **Update Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to **Clients** → Your OAuth client → **Authorized redirect URIs**
   - Add: `http://YOUR_DOMAIN:8767/` (or external port if using custom mapping)
   - **Must be a domain name, not an IP address**

2. **Update docker-compose.yml**:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - WEB_AUTH=true
     - OAUTH_HOST=gmail.example.com  # Just the hostname - NO http:// or https://
     # Optional: If using custom port mapping
     - OAUTH_EXTERNAL_PORT=18767
   ```

   > **⚠️ Common mistakes**:
   > - Use only the hostname (e.g., `gmail.example.com`), NOT the full URL (e.g., ~~`https://gmail.example.com`~~)
   > - Use a domain name, NOT an IP address (e.g., ~~`192.168.1.100`~~)

3. **For HTTPS with reverse proxy**:
   - The OAuth callback uses HTTP on port 8767 internally
   - Your reverse proxy should forward port 8767 for the OAuth callback
   - The **Authorized redirect URI** in Google Cloud must be `http://YOUR_DOMAIN:8767/` (HTTP, not HTTPS) or use the external port if mapped
   - Proxy both port 8766 (app) and port 8767 (OAuth callback) through your reverse proxy

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth & Authentication Issues

#### "Access blocked: Gmail Cleanup has not completed the Google verification process"

Your app is missing test users in the OAuth setup:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → Your Project
2. Go to **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
3. Scroll down to **Test users**
4. Click **Add Users** and add your Gmail address
5. Try signing in again

> **Why?** Since your app is in "Testing" mode, only emails listed as test users can sign in. This is normal and expected!

#### "Error 403: access_denied"

1. Make sure you created your **own** Google Cloud project and credentials
2. Make sure your email is added as a **Test user**
3. Make sure you downloaded `credentials.json` and placed it in the project folder

#### "Google hasn't verified this app" warning

This is normal for personal OAuth apps! Click **Continue** to proceed.

This warning appears because your app isn't published to Google - which is exactly what we want for privacy!

#### OAuth CSRF Error / State Mismatch

If you see `OAuth error: (mismatching_state) CSRF Warning`:

1. **Stop and clean up:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   rm -f token.json
   ```

2. **Clear browser cookies** for `accounts.google.com` (or use incognito/private window)

3. **Pull latest image and start fresh:**
   ```bash
   docker compose pull && docker compose up
   ```

4. Copy the OAuth URL from logs and paste in browser

#### Docker: "Where do I find the OAuth URL?"

Check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter name=gmail-cleaner)
```

Look for a URL starting with `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/...`

#### "Invalid Redirect: must end with a public top-level domain" or "Invalid Redirect: must use a domain that is a valid top private domain"

This error occurs when you try to use an **IP address** in the redirect URI (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8767/`).

**Google OAuth does NOT allow IP addresses** - you must use a domain name.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use localhost** (if accessing from the same machine):
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8767/`
   - Set `OAUTH_HOST=localhost` in docker-compose.yml

2. **Use a domain name** (if you own one):
   - Point your domain to your server's IP (via DNS A record)
   - Redirect URI: `http://gmail.yourdomain.com:8767/`
   - Set `OAUTH_HOST=gmail.yourdomain.com` in docker-compose.yml

3. **Use Dynamic DNS** (free option for home servers):
   - Sign up for a free DDNS service: [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/), [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/), or [Dynu](https://www.dynu.com/)
   - Get a domain like `mygmail.duckdns.org`
   - Point it to your server's public IP address
   - Redirect URI: `http://mygmail.duckdns.org:8767/`
   - Set `OAUTH_HOST=mygmail.duckdns.org` in docker-compose.yml

**Remember:** The redirect URI in Google Cloud Console must exactly match what you set in `OAUTH_HOST` + port.
